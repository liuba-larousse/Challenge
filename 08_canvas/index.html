        An artist is a person engaged in an activity related
        to creating art, practicing the arts, or
        demonstrating an art. The common usage in both
        everyday speech and academic discourse refers to a
        practitioner in the visual arts only. However, the
        term is also often used in the entertainment
        business, especially in a business context, for
        musicians and other performers (although less often
        for actors). "Artiste" (the French for artist) is a
        variant used in English in this context, but this
        use has become rare. Use of the term "artist" to
        describe writers is valid, but less common, and
        mostly restricted to contexts like that used in
        criticism.
